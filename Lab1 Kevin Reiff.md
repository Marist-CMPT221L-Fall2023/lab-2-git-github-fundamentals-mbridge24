# Hi, this is Kevin Reiff

## About Me
I'm still a little confused about GitHub in general and pull requests, but I'm hopefully getting the hang of it.

## What I Learned
- How to clone a repository
- Basic Markdown syntax

## What I'm Still Confused About
- The whole concept of pull requests
- Merging branches
