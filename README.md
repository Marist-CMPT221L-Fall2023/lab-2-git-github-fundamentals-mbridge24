* Open a pull request and let your instructor know that youâ€™ve finished this course.  
* Create a new markdown file in this repository. Let them know what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!
* Your new pull request should include a simple HTML file with simple css styling.  Use any tags and attributes you want, but it should display some sort of information about you -- think of it as a little introduction profile to who you are.
* Create your profile README. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
* Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them.
