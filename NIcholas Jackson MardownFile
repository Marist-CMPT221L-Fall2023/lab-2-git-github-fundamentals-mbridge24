I learned that a lot of people use Github even though they do not work for a company or a school! Github has a lot of collabarations so when people get
stuck on there code they can put it on Githin and someone can come in and help them with a project. Github is just a huge collabaratin site
where all people can come in and help each other.
I am still confused on how to use the styling tecniques and some of the pull request.
