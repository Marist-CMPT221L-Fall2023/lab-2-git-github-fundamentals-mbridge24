# **Shannon Maier Markdown Task** 

- I have learned more about how Pull Requests work and what they are used for.
- I am still somewhat confused about if I can merge a pull request to a certain folder within a repository.
- I am also confused about how this Markdown file will be seen becuase I don't have access to the repository, so it will become a new branch.
