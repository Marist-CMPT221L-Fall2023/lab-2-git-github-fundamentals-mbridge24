I learned that Git alllows us to collaboratively work on projects and code with team members by offering an efficent, simple and organized way to collectively work on the same project. 
I am still not confident on the exact function of the service, between the repositories, forking vs cloning, and exactly the process I need to use, but it seems intuitive enough for me to catch on.
